## HTML


### Html describes the structure of pages :

In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.


You can see the HTML code for this page below. Don't worry about what the code means yet. We start to look at it in more detail on the next page. Note that the HTML code is in blue, and the text you see on screen is in black.


```

<html>

   <body>

        <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>

        <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of  the page. And if the page is a long one it might  be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
        
        <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>  

        <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help  you follow the structure of what is being written.  There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level  headings).</p>

         <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2> 

         <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
     </body>

</html>
```

The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets â€” these are called HTML **elements**. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing **tags** has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

## JS

### what is a scrpit ? 

* A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal, the scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step.

* A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with web page 
* scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them

### writing a script ?
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

## HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER

* Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* Where possible, aim to keep the three languages in separate files, with the HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files.

* Each language forms a separate
layer with a different purpose.
Each layer, from left to right.
builds on the previous one.
