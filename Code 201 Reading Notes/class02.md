# HTML

### HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

### They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

## Heading

HTML has six "levels" of headings:

> < h1 > is used for main headings

> < h2 > is used for subheadings

If there are further sections under the subheadings then the < h3 > element is used, and so on..



```
<h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>

<h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>

<h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>

<h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>

<h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>

<h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6>

<h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>

<h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>

<h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>

<h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>

<h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6>

## Paragraphs


< p > To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p>tag and closing </p> tag

By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.


````
HTML
<p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences    that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The    start of a paragraph is indicated by a new    line.</p>

<p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up    into units of text. For example, a book may have    chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under    each heading there will be one or more    paragraphs.</p>

## Bold & iTalic

< b > 

By enclosing words in the tags < b > and < /b > we can make characters appear bold.

The < b > element also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for example key words in a paragraph) although the use of the < b > element does not imply any additional meaning.

< i > 

By enclosing words in the tags < i > and < /i > we can make characters appear italic.


The < i > element also represents a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content â€” such as technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be italicized.

* A language contain SYNTAX AND GRAMMAR like any new language, there are new words to learn (the vocabulary) and rules for how these can be put together (the grammar and syntax of the language).


* GIVING INSTRUCTIONS:
FOR A BROWSER TO FOLLOW
Web browsers (and computers in general)
approach tasks in a very different way than
a human might. Your instructions need to
reflect how computers get things done.

## STATEMENTS

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon.
