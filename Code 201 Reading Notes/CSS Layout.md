# CSS Layout


## Key Concepts inPositioning El ements


### Building Blocks
---------------
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.



Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use
borders, margins, padding, and background colors.


Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
< h1> < p > < ul > < li >

Inline elements
flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:
< img> < b> < i>


## Containing Elements
---------
If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element
