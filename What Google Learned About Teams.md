# What Google Learned About Teams

what I learned from what I read about  Rozovsky  and Sakaguchi :


You need to find  the appropriate place you will feel better in, even if the work does not belong to your major and you start learning about it,  like what we are doing here my major English and french literature but I knew I will be a good programmer if I spend time on learning, and you need to choose the right teamwork who can understand each other and work together without problems,

and when Rozovsky said :
>’’ There were ideas about clothing swaps. Most of the proposals were impractical, but we all felt like we could say anything to each other, Rozovsky told me. No one worried that the rest of the team was judging them.’’ 


"Life's problems wouldn't be called " hurdles" if there wasn't a way to get over them."

So don't stop and work on your dreams to be something in the future
